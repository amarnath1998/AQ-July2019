Web API is a ASP.NET's Framework for developing REST Services. 
Introduced in 2013 for developing REST services in .NET. 
Its design is based on the MVC but with no View in it. 
It has a controller which implements an interface called System.Web.Http.IHttpController which contains Actions that are executed thro HTTP VERBS: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. 
The output of the Actions are rendered as both XML and JSON. XML Parsers will read the data as XML Document and JSON readers would read it as JSON Result.
